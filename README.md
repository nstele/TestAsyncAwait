# TestAsyncAwait

Test Swift 5.5 new feature for handle asynchronous code almost is if it were synchronous.
This is done in two steps: marking async functions with the new async keyword, then calling them using the await keyword, similar to other languages such as C# and JavaScript.

To see how async/await helps the language, itâ€™s helpful to look at how we solved the same problem previously. Completion handlers are commonly used in Swift code to allow us to send back values after a function returns, but they had tricky syntax.

The addition of async/await fits perfectly alongside try/catch, meaning that async functions and initializers can throw errors if needed. The only proviso here is that Swift enforces a particular order for the keywords, and that order is reversed between call site and function.
